The world's most devilishly addictive defense game is back - welcome to Kingdom Rush: Frontiers! 

"Kingdom Rush Frontiers" is a game that combines Tower Defense, quirky humor and fantasy gameplay. The goal is to build many types of towers to attack incoming enemies, and stop them from getting past your defenses.

Bigger and badder than ever before, Kingdom Rush: Frontiers is a whole new level of the furiously fast, enchantingly charming gameplay that made the original title an award-winning hit. Tap your troops through an epic (mis)adventure as you defend exotic lands from dragons, man-eating plants, and ghastly denizens of the underworld -all with flashy new towers, levels, heroes, and more goodies to help you crush your foes to a pulp. (Don't worry, we've still got all the good ol' stuff from the last game, too. It's vintage now.) 

Kingdom Rush: Frontiers packs in so much content, it's like a fully upgraded artillery blast of mouthwatering, pixelated joy launched right into your smiling little face... and it hurts so good!
