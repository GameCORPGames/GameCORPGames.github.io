Do you like jumping?  Do like spikes?  There are both in this game, and a handful of different ways to try to beat the only level in the game.  Confront each new stage challenge with a sort of heart and dignity that we can only befall on our most noble of creatures.  Also you can unlock a velociraptor, how cool how is that?
